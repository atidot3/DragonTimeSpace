# DragonTimeSpace

This project is in hiatus for now, we leave it public for anyone who want to continue, most of the basics are working such as login / character selection creation etc and entering in game.

# Basic usage
you need to setup a mariadb database and fill it with the skeleto available here:
https://github.com/atidot3/DragonTimeSpace/blob/master/DragonTimeSpace/Data/Sql/dbo.sql

You'll need to edit the Assembly-CSharp and change the ip 192.168.1.10 to your current server ip location.
You can use dnSpy for this.

Again : https://github.com/atidot3/DragonTimeSpace/blob/master/DragonTimeSpace/Auth/Source/AuthSocket.cpp#L78
Change it with your GCServer ip.

Change Auth.json and GCServer.json parameters to your current needs.
